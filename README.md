### Desktop flashcard app for creating, reviewing, and managing flashcards, with AI-generated sets for any topic.

### User Stories

answers, so that I can study any topic (e.g. SOLID principles) [handled by Qishan].
2. As a user, I want to **review my flashcards** to help me memorize information more
effectively [handled by Caleb].
3. As a user, I want to **prompt AI to generate flashcards** based on a topic I provide,
so that I can quickly build a study set [handled by Faiyad].
4. As a user, I want to **enable AI features**, so I enter an Gemini API key [handed by Albert].
